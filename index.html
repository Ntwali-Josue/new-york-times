                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son
                    and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                    beyond the world of known physics.

                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A
                    potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                    special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of
                    light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                    and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                    in
                    the ocean.

                    the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered

                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent

                    of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of
                    time
                    and space and energy to science and speculation.

                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with
                    its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent,
                    architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
                    number
                    of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
